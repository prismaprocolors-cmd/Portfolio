# Colorist Portfolio (Vite + React)

This is a minimal starter for a colorist portfolio inspired by the referenced site. It uses Vite + React and includes a gallery, hero, and simple lightbox.

Try it locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Replace `public/assets/*` with your high-quality thumbnails and full images.
- Edit `src/components` to update copy, links and contact details.
